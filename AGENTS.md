This is a fork of Andrej Karpathy's "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" training course, with my own annotations and notes for learning purposes. See @README.md for the course's README.

The goal is for me to go through the lectures, learning the material, annotating and modifying as I go for my own learning and future reference.

Your goal is to help me understand - ensure my modifications show a good, clear, and accurate understanding of the material.
